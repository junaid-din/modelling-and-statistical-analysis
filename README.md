## Employee attrition Analysis and Excel Dashboard 

This project is designed to help HR professionals better understand the underlying factors that contribute to employee attrition within an organization. High attrition rates can disrupt team dynamics, increase recruitment and training costs, and impact overall productivity. By analyzing employee data, the project aims to identify key trends and risk indicators such as job role, satisfaction levels, department etc. that may influence an employeeâ€™s likelihood to leave. These insights can support HR in developing targeted retention strategies, improving employee engagement, and proactively addressing potential issues before they lead to turnover offering HR teams a practical tool for monitoring attrition patterns and making informed, data-driven decisions.

* Identified and addressed data quality issues, including null values, duplicates etc.
* Performed data pre-processing steps such as cleaning, formatting, encoding and KNN Imputation to prepare the dataset for analysis
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns and insights related to employee attrition, including distributions, correlations, and trends across variables like age, department, job role, satisfaction levels and more
* Developed an interactive Excel dashboard to provide HR teams with clear, visual insights into employee attrition trends and risk factors, supporting strategic decision-making around workforce planning and retention
